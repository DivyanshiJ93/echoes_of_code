+     1: # Echoes of Code
+     2:
+     3: A 2D top-down puzzle game where you solve puzzles by collaborating with echoes of your past actions.
+     4:
+     5: ## Game Concept
+     6:
+     7: In "Echoes of Code," you play as a software engineer trapped in a glitched digital world. Every 10 seconds, time resets, but your past actions are replayed by a ghost clone (called an "echo"). You must use these echoes strategically to solve puzzles and escape each level.
+     8:
+     9: ## Gameplay Mechanics
+    10:
+    11: - **Time Loop System**: Each loop lasts 10 seconds. When time resets, your previous actions are replayed by an echo.
+    12: - **Multiple Echoes**: As you progress through loops, more echoes appear, each replaying a different past loop.
+    13: - **Puzzle Elements**: Use pressure plates, terminals, and switches that require coordination between your current self and past echoes.
+    14: - **Limited Loops**: Each level has a maximum number of loops to solve the puzzle.
+    15:
+    16: ## Controls
+    17:
+    18: - **Movement**: WASD or Arrow Keys
+    19: - **Interact**: E key (for terminals and switches)
+    20: - **Restart Level**: R key
+    21: - **Quit**: ESC key
+    22:
+    23: ## Level Design
+    24:
+    25: The game includes two levels with progressive difficulty:
+    26:
+    27: 1. **Level 1**: Simple pressure plate and gate puzzle
+    28: 2. **Level 2**: More complex puzzle with terminal and multiple gates
+    29:
